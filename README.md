# Image-Generation-with-Pre-trained-Models

This project demonstrates how to generate images from textual descriptions using pre-trained generative models such as DALLÂ·E-mini and Stable Diffusion. These models are capable of translating natural language prompts into high-quality, AI-generated visuals. By leveraging powerful open-source tools and frameworks, users can experiment with a wide variety of text-to-image scenarios, enabling creative exploration and rapid prototyping without the need to train models from scratch.
